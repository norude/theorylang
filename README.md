# Theorylang

A rust-based toy language to explore type theory, category theory and other stuff functional bros like

## Goals
Make the source code as simple as possible.
Use a lexer generator and a parser generator.

## Backend
I don't really care, so it'll probably be an interpreter

## Syntax
be simple, C-style, but think over function calls, postfixes and prefixes
